  abstract = {This article provides an update on the global cancer burden using the GLOBOCAN 2020 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases (18.1 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) occurred in 2020. Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7\%), followed by lung (11.4\%), colorectal (10.0 \%), prostate (7.3\%), and stomach (5.6\%) cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18\%), followed by colorectal (9.4\%), liver (8.3\%), stomach (7.7\%), and female breast (6.9\%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2-fold to 3-fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied {$<$}2-fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47\% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64\% to 95\%) versus transitioned (32\% to 56\%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy. Efforts to build a sustainable infrastructure for the dissemination of cancer prevention measures and provision of cancer care in transitioning countries is critical for global cancer control.

There is a widespread immediate drop in both criminal incidents and arrests most heavily pronounced among drug crimes, theft, residential burglaries, and most violent crimes. The decline appears to precede stay-at-home orders, and arrests follow a similar pattern as reports. There is no decline in homicides and shootings, and an increase in non-residential burglary and car theft in most cities, suggesting that criminal activity was displaced to locations with fewer people. Pittsburgh, New York City, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Washington DC and Chicago each saw overall crime drops of at least 35\%. Evidence from police-initiated reports and geographic variation in crime change suggests that most of the observed changes are not due to changes in crime reporting.},

This study use a mixed research method, where data is collected from facts in the field, legal sources or applied regulations, associated with legal materials obtained from literature review research and overall data obtained from both primary data and secondary data. The conclusion from this research is that street crime during the Covid-19 Pandemic cannot be stated expressly decreased or increased for each region has dynamics that differ from one another according to the characteristics of the region. The correlation of PSBB policy during the Covid-19 Pandemic with the level of street crime in the perspective of routine activity theory can be seen from several street crimes that change the type and location of their objects / targets as well as the increasing number of drug and cybercrime cases that are striking. PSBB conditions during Pandemic Covid-19 against crimes that require a new system that is integrated with the internet, a pattern of punishment with massive amounts of assimilation to reduce the density of prison and a virtual court examination system that should be a part of the criminal justice system in Indonesia},

        Much of crime mapping is devoted to detecting high-crime density areas known as hot spots. Hot spot analysis assists police in identifying high-crime areas, types of crime being committed, and the best way to respond. Hot spot analysis depends on several factors which vary. These varying factors or elements necessary in analyzing hot spots include: analysis focus, spatial dependence, crime type, time intervals, barriers, output display, and software. In addition, establishing a stronger link between theory and practice will help avoid the arbitrary approaches to hot spot analysis and give an analyst a scientific foundation from which to work. The report is comprised of three main chapters. Chapter 1 is targeted to novices in crime mapping defining crime hot spots; what they are, why they exist, and how to map them. Chapter 2 is more advanced discussing the methods and techniques for understanding crime hot spots. The third chapter is geared to those highly experienced analysts providing spatial analysis tools for identifying hot spots. The report can be used as a companion to a 1999 National Institute of Justice report, entitled Crime Mapping: Principle and Practice. Exhibits, references
